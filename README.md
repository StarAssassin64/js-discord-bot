# Discord Bot
**Made in JavaScript**
*Made as a passion project, learning to do more commands*

**Plan for the bot**
  Planning on making the bot for tracking server stats, like StatBot

**Planned Commands**
  * `serverStats` - gives detailed information about the server
  * `userStats` - gives detailed information about the user
    * `{user}` - optional format to allow people to enter another person
  * `serverStatsDock` - potential command that puts some server info as discord voice channels. this is all dependent if I need to run an SQL server
